# **About Me**

`Hello, World!` I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
but you can call me **Gabriel Horns**.<br><br>
Some time ago, I used to be both a [*trumpet and a Mathematical paradox*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_Horn) (check it out on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_Horn): nice fact, isn't it?); these days, I am just a guy striving for personal growth on a daily basis.<br>
I like to sing, but I am not a pop star. I like to eat, but I am not a chef. I like to code, but I am an engineer.<br>
*Thumbs up* if you like Linux and the open-source community.
